				<p class="introText">Infraguard is an open-source web-based SSH console that manages the administrative access to systems centrally. It develops its own public or private SSH key at the beginning which is later placed in the authorized key file of the systems. Infraguard will let you upload files to multiple systems at the same time. You will also be able to share terminal commands to different systems simultaneously. Multiple system administers can be added while auditing their sessions. Infraguard can also manage, distribute and disable public keys which have been set up within the application.</p>
